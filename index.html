      <h1>Hi My name is Greg Heaphy, I'm 25 and I've been playing the piano since the age of 3. The music of Mr. Bach is very near and dear to my heart and I plan on continuing and studying his amazing music for the rest of my days. I studied music composition in college and I hope to develop a working life with that skill in the future. If it were not for my studies in music I would not have developed an interest in computer programming; both of which are creative endeavors that are at the same time deeply concerned with structure.</h1>
